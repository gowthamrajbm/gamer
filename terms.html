					This Terms & Conditions explains how information about you is collected, used, and disclosed by GameTown.com  to  any parent or subsidiary (collectively, âGameTown,â âourâ, âusâ or âweâ) when you access or use GameTown  website, mobile applications, and other products and services (collectively, the âServicesâ) or otherwise interact with us.  This policy applies to GameTown , website, applications, and other technologies (we collectively refer to these as âServicesâ).<br>


					<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>

					For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Name, Email Address, Mobile Number. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

					The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

					<h4>Accessing and updating your information</h4>

					We aim to provide you with a reasonable opportunity to access, update, and delete to your account. In some cases, we may have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

					<h4>Cookies</h4>

					Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

					This Service does not use these âcookiesâ explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use âcookiesâ to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

					<h4>Information security</h4>

					We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections. However, since no software or storage system is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee for the security of your information associated with the Services, or any other service for that matter. You can help protect your account information by using unique and hard-to-guess passwords. We generally store data for as long as we have a valid business purpose or if we are legally required to do so.

					Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Policy changes on this page, including material changes. Please check back periodically to view changes to our privacy policy.
